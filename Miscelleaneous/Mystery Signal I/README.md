# Mystery Signal I
The goal is to decode the transmission received from the audio file.

### Step-1:
After downloading the MysterySignal_I (.wav audio file), i first played it on my local audio player for any hints about the kind of transmission.

### Step-3:
Upn hearing the audio, I felt that the audio has morse code signals from the way it sounded. I quickly uploaded the audio in an online morse code reader. There are multiple websites but i used this one 👉🏻 https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html

### Step-4:
As i uploaded the message on the morse coder decoder, i got this message👇🏻

### Step-5:`
Wrapping the given message in the DawgCTF{} format, i got the final flag which is `DawgCTF{L I S T E N C A R E F U L L Y}`.
