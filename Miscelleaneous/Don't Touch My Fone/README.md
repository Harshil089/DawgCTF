# Don't Touch My Fone

The main idea is to decode the audio file to get the flag.

### Step-1:
After downloading dtmf (.wav audio file) from the cloud, I initially opened in my default music player to listen for any noticable words or sketchy tunes.

### Step-3:
Since the file name is dtmf, my second thought was to put the file to a online dtmf waves decoder.
There are multiple tools, but the one i used was from this website 👉🏻
https://dtmf.netlify.app

### Step-4:
Upon uploading the audio file, we get this message:

### Step-4:
Wrap the decoded message in DawgCTF{} format.


Here is the final flag after decoding the dtmf tune:

DawgCTF{410455350}
