You can just screenshot a part of the bridge that shows the buildings an put it on
google. It will show that this building is in Panama City and then after that on the
opposite side of those buildings there are many skyscrapers so then I searched it
and it showed many cities near the coast with the area. Then I walked through all
the roads which were going through the sea side and then after few checks I found
the Costa Costera. Then “walk” around the bridge to find the exact location.

It’s an aquarium, and outside there’s a Submarine/Boat labeled “E 423” with
markings that appear to include “USS” or something like that. A quick search in
Google shows that its the National Aquarium located by Baltimore Bay. Then I saw
many naval bases in that area so to narrow it down Then I searched the red
building in front of the submarine and then found the area and after some time got
that location.

### Solving the Challenge

After looking at the place, we can see that there is a Sign saying something like
Nation Building Program, roads to Recovery. When I searched that on Google, you
can see that its a Australian Program. So the place we are looking for is in
Australia. Then we see another two Road Signs. In the readable one, we could
read something like "EAST WEST BASELINE, ...4 Lockout 400m, The Bl..holes 12".
We can see that we are in a paved road and the one besides has a speed sign
(60km/h max), there are a lot of trees.
So, maybe I thought this is a main Road called EAST WEST BASELINE, is
touristic.. When i searched for “EAST WEST BASELINE road” several websites
appear indicating its on Christmas Island. There is a website with a map that sows
where is the LB4 point. I searched for "Christmas Island EAST WEST BASELINE"
and it showed me a Road in the Christmas Island. Then find a place in the EAST
WEST BASELINE that intercepts with another Road and is 400m from LB4 Lockout
and 12 km from The Blowholes and then after street viewing it found the exact
location.

At first sight, we can see that we are inside an Aquarium and we spot a café
named “Seafood Watch Café, Monterey Aquarium.” However, when I check out
pictures of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, there’s no café nor do the café’s features
match those of the Aquarium. To dig deeper, we searched for franchises or
locations associated with the “Seafood Watch Café” and checked all those cafè’s
When we search the Area with the Google Street View, we looked for a red/brown
building Outside and see that the building the Cafe is in has red parts.

Straight ahead, we can see small houses and two signs. One reads “8th E .. T”
while the other says “Cleveland 3800 Ave E.” We can see that it’s in the United
States. To find this we can either search for Cleveland 3800 Ave E and see in
Google Street where is the right place and then search for the 8th St, and then
searched for a white mistibuishi car parked after 2 cars I front of a red building and
go it!

### Solving the Challenge

Here, we see penguins, which suggests we’re in the south, as polar bears are
found in the north. There’s also an Argentine flag, a red house.

Given these clues, it’s likely that this location is in Antarctica, specifically in an area
that has something to do with to Argentina. Searching for “red house Argentina
Antarctica” on Google helped narrow down the search. I found a post with the Red
house of the picture with this title Argentine research hut on Petermann Island,
Pygoscelis papua, Peterman Island, Antarctic.

If you search for it on Google, you'll find that it's called the Groussac Refuge.
The Groussac Refuge (Spanish: Refugio naval Groussac, originally Refugio naval
Hipólito Bouchard) is an Argentine shelter located on the south coast of Port
Circumcision on Petermann Island, off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.
You can search for Petermann Island using Google Street View, and since the area
is relatively small, it’s easy to find the location. Also, you can find expedition maps
from Oceanwide Expeditions that show the specific side of the island where they


do the tours.
