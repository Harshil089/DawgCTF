# Don't Touch My Fone

The main idea is to decode the audio file to get the flag.

### Step-1:
After downloading dtmf (.wav audio file) from the cloud, I initially opened in my default music player to listen for any noticable words or sketchy tunes.

### Step-3:
Since the file name is dtmf, my second thought was to put the file to a online dtmf waves decoder.
There are multiple tools, but the one i used was from this website 👇🏻
