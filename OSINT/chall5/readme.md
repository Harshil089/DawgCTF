### Solving the Challenge
It’s an aquarium, and outside there’s a Submarine/Boat labeled “E 423” with 
markings that appear to include “USS” or something like that. A quick search in 
Google shows that its the National Aquarium located by Baltimore Bay. Then I saw 
many naval bases in that area so to narrow it down Then I searched the red 
building in front of the submarine and then found the area and after some time got 
that location.
