### Solving the Challenge
At first sight, we can see that we are inside an Aquarium and we spot a café 
named “Seafood Watch Café, Monterey Aquarium.” However, when I check out 
pictures of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, there’s no café nor do the café’s features 
match those of the Aquarium. To dig deeper, we searched for franchises or 
locations associated with the “Seafood Watch Café” and checked all those cafè’s 
When we search the Area with the Google Street View, we looked for a red/brown 
building Outside and see that the building the Cafe is in has red parts.
