### Solving the Challenge
After looking at the place, we can see that there is a Sign saying something like 
Nation Building Program, roads to Recovery. When I searched that on Google, you 
can see that its a Australian Program. So the place we are looking for is in 
Australia. Then we see another two Road Signs. In the readable one, we could 
read something like "EAST WEST BASELINE, ...4 Lockout 400m, The Bl..holes 12". 
We can see that we are in a paved road and the one besides has a speed sign 
(60km/h max), there are a lot of trees.

So, maybe I thought this is a main Road called EAST WEST BASELINE, is 
touristic.. When i  searched for “EAST WEST BASELINE road” several websites 
appear indicating its on Christmas Island. There is a website with a map that sows 
where is the LB4 point. I searched for "Christmas Island EAST WEST BASELINE" 
and it showed me a Road in the Christmas Island. Then find a place in the EAST 
WEST BASELINE that intercepts with another Road and is 400m from LB4 Lockout 
and 12 km from The Blowholes and then after street viewing it found the exact 
location .
