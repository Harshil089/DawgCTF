## GEOSINT — chall4 — Easy

### Solving the Challenge
You can just screenshot a part of the bridge that shows the buildings an put it on 
google. It will show that this building is in Panama City and then after that on the 
opposite side of those buildings there are many skyscrapers so then I searched it 
and it showed many cities near the coast with the area. Then I walked through all 
the roads which were going through the sea side and then after few checks I found 
the Costa Costera. Then “walk” around the bridge to find the exact location.
