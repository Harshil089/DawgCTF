### Solving the Challenge
Here, we see penguins, which suggests we’re in the south, as polar bears are 
found in the north. There’s also an Argentine flag, a red house. 

Given these clues, it’s likely that this location is in Antarctica, specifically in an area 
that has something to do with to Argentina. Searching for “red house Argentina 
Antarctica” on Google helped narrow down the search. I found a post with the Red 
house of the picture with this title Argentine research hut on Petermann Island, 
Pygoscelis papua, Peterman Island, Antarctic. 

If you search for it on Google, you'll find that it's called the Groussac Refuge.

The Groussac Refuge (Spanish: Refugio naval Groussac, originally Refugio naval 
Hipólito Bouchard) is an Argentine shelter located on the south coast of Port 
Circumcision on Petermann Island, off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. 
You can search for Petermann Island using Google Street View, and since the area 
is relatively small, it’s easy to find the location. Also, you can find expedition maps 
from Oceanwide Expeditions that show the specific side of the island where they do the tours.
