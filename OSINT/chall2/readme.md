## GEOSINT _ chall 2 -Easy

### Solving the Challenge
Analize the Place: by analyzing the surroundings: low-rise houses, yellowish walls, 
and vehicles with the driver’s seat on the left. The language on signs was English, 
and there are businesses like Goldcar rental and a pet supply delivery from a brand 
called “Prince.” These details with the architecture/color of the walls pointed to 
Malta.

To narrow it down further, I searched for pet shops in Malta and looked for names 
ending in “-fastic.” That led us straight to the location. Gotcha!
