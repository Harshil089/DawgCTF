Magnum Opus Challenge
I was watching a chess game, and was wowed extremely with the positional thinking I saw from white. I had to step away, unfortunately…. that was a long time ago, and I still want to see how the game developed. Given the first few moves which I wrote down, can you find out what this game was called?



Solving the Challenge
Let’s check the chess moves to see if its a common opening etc:
1. e4 d6 2. d4 f6 (2... Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 c6 6. f3 b5 7. Nge2 Nbd7

This looks like it could be a variation of the Pirc Defense and I found Website that says this moves are related to the Pirc Defense.
2. Searched several Chess Games and found this:

3. Based on the information we’ve gathered it clearly references the same opening and the same move progression seen in the famous 1999 Kasparov–Topalov match.

That Match is often called Kasparov’s Immortal or just The Immortal Game of the 20th Century
