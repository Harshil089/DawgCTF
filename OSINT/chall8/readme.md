### Solving the Challenge
Straight ahead, we can see small houses and two signs. One reads “8th E .. T” 
while the other says “Cleveland 3800 Ave E.” We can see that it’s in the United 
States. To find this we can either search for Cleveland 3800 Ave E and see in 
Google Street where is the right place and then search for the 8th St, and then 
searched for a white mistibuishi car parked after 2 cars I front of a red building and 
go it !
