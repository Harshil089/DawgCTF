### Solving the Challenge
You can simply take a screenshot of the station and search the image on Google. It 
will lead you to websites showing the image of the train station and information for 
Largo Town Center and Morgan Boulevard Metro Stations.

After a bit more searching, we can confirm that it’s the Morgan Boulevard Metro 
Station. If you search for Morgan Boulevard or Morgan Metro, in Maryland on 
Google Maps, you’ll find it easily.
