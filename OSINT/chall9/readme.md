### Solving the Challenge
Analysing properly I saw a sign board which was written in Chinese , Japanese or 
Korea so tried using snippet tool and searching the coastal area and the ropeway 
thing I got many places similar but then I checked for towers on the mountains it 
narrowed down and I got to know that this was situated in Japan and after 
searching for famous coastal places I got to know it was Sanchō Tenbōdai Station, 
Mt. Hakodate Ropeway.  After searching more I got to know the exact location.
